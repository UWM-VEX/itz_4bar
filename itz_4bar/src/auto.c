/*
 * Runs the user autonomous code. This function will be started in its own task

with the default
 * priority and stack size whenever the robot is enabled via the Field Management

System or the
 * VEX Competition Switch in the autonomous mode. If the robot is disabled or

communications is
 * lost, the autonomous task will be stopped by the kernel. Re-enabling the robot

will restart
 * the task, not re-start it from where it left off.
 *
 * Code running in the autonomous task cannot access information from the VEX

Joystick. However,
 * the autonomous function can be invoked from another task if a VEX Competition

Switch is not
 * available, and it can access joystick information if called in this way.
 *
 * The autonomous task may exit, unlike operatorControl() which should never exit.

If it does
 * so, the robot will await a switch to another mode or disable/enable cycle.

/**
 * This is where you declare all of the actions the robot will take.
 * The options are DriveForTime which is useful for driving into something
 * but shouldn't be used elsewhere, DriveToWayPoint, which will handle
 * driving forward and back, strafing, and turning (turning must be in
 * its own step) and AutoLiftToHeight which will bring the lift to a
 * specified height (Note: Once the step where this function is used has
 * completed, the lift will move down due to gravity. To avoid this,
 * create a new AutoLiftToHeight function to keep the lift at the desired
 * height. Also, the lift to height code isn't perfectly tuned yet,
 * if the autonomous stalls with the autoLiftToHeight function, help the
 * lift up.)
 *
 * Running the pickup or spinner does not require an object to be declared
 * or instantiated, an example is shown below.
